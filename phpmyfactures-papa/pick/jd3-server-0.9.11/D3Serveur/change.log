version 0.9.11 :
  - improvement made by Marc Dubois (see readme_NT.txt) to fix NT socket shutdown problem

version 0.9.10 :
  - Some changes made by Cedric Fontaine to manage free port available on jd3 server

version 0.9.9:
  - Use option SO$REUSEADDR on socket to prevent blocking after crash or bad shutdown.(don't know if it's
    really working)

version 0.9.8:
  - Some minor bug corrections

version 0.9.7:
  - Improve management of free ports :
        . different for each server, so now you could start a server for normal activity
          and another for development, and don't crash all child for normal user (only
          child from development server)

        . never loop for ever when there is no more child free, just wait 5 second
          (see MAXTRY in the code) before refuse connection

        . check if a free port is really free or killed (logged off) by another process (or user)

  - J-STOP :  now really stop the main server with all child

version 0.9.6 :
  - D3CLIENT : new option
                   -s xxx to know the pid of the main server, used by new commands (see bellow)

  - D3SERVER : new option
                -h  to see all options available
                -c xxx  to specify number of child to start
                -cp xxx  to specify the starting port for the child

  - new command  :
        j-startup   to start a new server as a phantom
        j-stop      to stop a server
        j-status    to show status of the server(s)

  - All the system use FJ.PORTS file to store information about connection

version 0.9.5 :
  - little change in the protocol for the Execute query:
    possibility to make data for execute command, and why not execute many command at one time
    see protocol.txt to know how it change (or read the code;)

    Still compatible with old protocol
